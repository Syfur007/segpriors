# scripts/reproduce.sh — Phase 14 (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md): orchestrates
# the S1-S17 pipeline end to end, in reduced-scope form by default
# (SEEDS/MODEL_CONFIG/EPOCHS env vars below) so this script is genuinely
# runnable as a smoke test, not just documentation.
#
# Honest about what each stage actually is today:
#   - S1, S6, S15, S17 have real, working commands below — this script
#     executes them for real.
#   - S3/S4/S5 reuse S6's same train.py/orchestration.sweep machinery
#     (a "sanity"/"baseline"/"LR-sweep" run *is* a train.py run with
#     different config knobs — there is no separate binary for them).
#   - S2, S7-S14, S16 have no standalone CLI script (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
#     Phases 4/9/11/12/13 built them as importable Python modules, meant
#     to be driven from a notebook/analysis script once real multi-seed
#     checkpoints exist to analyse) — this script prints the exact
#     module/function to call for each rather than faking a command that
#     doesn't exist.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/reproduce.sh
#   SEEDS="42 43 44" MODEL_CONFIG=configs/experiment/mkunet/mkunet_t_clinicdb.yaml ./scripts/reproduce.sh
#
# Reduced-scope defaults below trade off against IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md's
# own end-to-end verification instruction ("1 seed, 1 fold, 2 datasets"):
# SEEDS defaults to 3, not 1 — S17's own minimum-seeds blocking rule
# (spec §18: 3 minimum) would otherwise correctly refuse to emit S6's
# table, so a literal 1-seed run cannot finish this script successfully.
