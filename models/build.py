models/build.py — capacity control: search a model family's width-scaling
knob for a configuration matching a target parameter/FLOPs budget.

Used for width-matched capacity controls (a plain RGB baseline width-matched
to a wider-input-channel model's parameter count, so a performance
difference isn't just "more parameters") — any model family that exposes a
width knob (e.g. MK-UNet's channels list, one per T/S/base/M/L preset) can
be searched.
