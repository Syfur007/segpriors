training/determinism.py — the one seed_everything() entry point, replacing
train.py's former local ``set_seed()`` and eval.py's former total absence of
seeding.

Also configures torch for deterministic execution and *records* (rather than
silently drops) any op torch cannot actually run deterministically, so a run
can be reported non-reproducible instead of assumed reproducible — the
point is that a nondeterministic op shows up in the manifest instead of
being missed.

    Non-deterministic ops are not raised on (``warn_only=True``): several
    ops this codebase already depends on have no deterministic CUDA kernel
    in torch 1.13, and raising would make training unusable rather than
    just imprecisely reproducible. Instead, every such warning is captured
    — call :func:`get_recorded_nondeterminism` after the run to fetch them
    (e.g. to attach to a run manifest) and :func:`reset_recorded_nondeterminism`
    before each new run so warnings don't leak across runs sharing a
